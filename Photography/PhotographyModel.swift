The subject should be clearly separated from its background (at least 10 meters away) and neither too close nor too far away from you (around 2 - 5 meters from you). Make sure you are focusing on the subject, not the background, and take pictures of the subject at all of the aperture's f-stops. While taking the pictures, pay attention to how the shutter speed compensates for changes in the aperture’s f-stop. Moving one f-stop in either direction should cause the shutter speed to either halve or double in order to keep a constant exposure. \n\nBack on your computer, notice how the depth of field changes with aperture. The background should become more blurry as the f-stop decreases and more in-focus as the f-stop increases. Also compare the sharpness of images at your smallest and largest f-stop when you are 100% zoomed. The largest f-stop image should be noticeably less sharp than the smallest f-stop image. ","Put your camera in shutter speed priority mode and choose a well lit, static subject. Without a tripod, take pictures of the subject at all of the available shutter speeds, and pay attention to how the aperture compensates for changes in the shutter speed. Moving the shutter speed one stop in either direction should cause the aperture to adjust by one stop in order to keep a constant exposure. \n\nBack on your computer, view the images at 100% magnification. The images that have a slower shutter speed should appear brighter and more blurred than the ones with a faster shutter speed. Find the speed at which you go from blurred to in-focus images. This is your handheld limit, the limit at which you can take in-focus images without using a tripod.", "Put your camera in shutter speed priority mode or aperture priority mode and find a well lit subject. Take pictures of the subject at every ISO your camera offers, starting at the base ISO and ending at the highest ISO. If you are on aperture priority mode, notice how the shutter speed becomes shorter as the ISO increases. On shutter speed priority mode, take note of how the ISO impacts the aperture. \n\nBack on your computer, look at your images and take note of the ISO level at which you start noticing noise and the level at which you notice an unacceptable amount of noise. Some noise is inevitable, especially if you are shooting photos in tough situations like at nighttime. Finding your highest level of acceptable noise should help you produce bright enough photos that have an acceptable amount of noise.", "Without moving, take pictures of the same subject at 5mm increments of your lens’ focal length range. Then, move as close to the subject as your most zoomed in image. If your lens has a focal length of 18-55mm, move towards the subject in order to replicate the frame of the 55mm image that you shot. Take a picture of this similar frame with your camera’s widest focal length. \n\nBack on your computer, compare the last two images. Take note of the similarities and the differences between the two. Also, try to spot compression in the series of photos that you shot while you were immobile and distortion in the wide angle picture."]

The camera will set the shutter speed to a value that maintains the exposure based on the aperture and ISO values that you selected. If there is too much light, the camera will use a faster shutter speed, and if there is not enough light, the camera will use a slower shutter speed.\n\nUse Aperture-Priority mode when you want to control depth of field as your top priority. For example, Aperture-Priority mode can help you take a portrait that has a shallow depth of field and a blurred background.", "In Shutter-Priority mode (S on Nikon, Tv on Canon), you can manually set the shutter speed and the ISO, while the camera automatically sets the aperture for you. The camera will set the aperture to a value that maintains the exposure based on the shutter speed and ISO values that you selected. If there is too much light, the camera will use a higher aperture, and if there is not enough light, the camera will use a lower aperture. Some cameras do not have a low enough aperture number to compensate for a fast shutter speed, so your image may be underexposed.\n\nUse Shutter-Priority mode when you want to freeze action (e.g, sports or wildlife photography) or when you want to intentionally blur motion (e.g., flowing water).", "In Manual mode, the camera puts you in full control of the exposure, allowing you to manually set the aperture, the shutter speed, and the ISO. Shutter-Priority or Aperture-priority mode should be sufficient for most of the photographs that you will take, but Manual mode can be extremely helpful in extreme lighting situations. For example, if you are taking a picture of a bright subject, the camera might incorrectly guess the exposure and either overexpose or underexpose other elements in the image.\n\nManual mode also maintains consistency by enabling you to use the same settings across multiple exposures. This tends to be useful when creating a panorama, as all of the images will have the same amount of darkness or brightness depending entirely on the parameters that you set."]
